MGEScan
=======

MGEScan is a computational method for identifying long terminal repeats (LTR) and non-LTR retroelements in eukaryotic genomic sequences. MGEScan-LTR is a de novo computational method identifies new LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons without relying on a library of known elements. Specifically, the method identifies intact LTR retrotransposons by using an approximate string matching technique and protein domain analysis.

MGEScan-non-LTR is an computational approach to the identification of non-LTR retrotransposons in genomic sequences, based on a generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM), in which the hidden states represent the protein domains and linker regions encoded in the non-LTR retrotransposons, and their emission probabilities are modeled by profile hidden Markov models (for protein domains) and Gaussian Bayes classifiers (for linker regions), respectively.
